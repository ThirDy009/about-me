      <h2>My Family</h2>
      <p>
        I come from a close-knit family. I have one brother, Stephen, and I am
        the youngest. My father, who sadly passed away, was a great role model,
        and my mother has been a constant source of support and encouragement.
        We enjoy spending time together, whether it's having family dinners or
        watching movies. Despite the challenges, my family has always been there
        for me, and I'm grateful for their love and support.
